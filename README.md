# tensorflow-flowmasterB-teaching

This series is a full educational follow along to learn TensorFlow. I recommend having dev xp and a good understanding of computer science.
Thank you for your time and consideration. When this in-progress project is finished (it is ongoing in-progress), you will know enough TensorFlow to hopefully pass the exam - no guarantee -- that's up to you and your efforts and results. Good luck. :-)
