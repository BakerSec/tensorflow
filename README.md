# tensorflow-flowmasterB-teaching

This series is a full educational follow along to learn TensorFlow. I recommend having dev xp and a good understanding of computer science.
Thank you for your time and consideration. When this in-progress project is finished (it is ongoing in-progress), you will know enough TensorFlow to hopefully pass the exam - no guarantee -- that's up to you and your efforts and results. Good luck. :-)

01_Neural_Network_Regression_with_Tensorflow.ipynb has 2 other notebook version due to the sensitivity of model run results least accurate model

01_Neural_Network_Regression_with_Tensorflow-A.ipynb -- notebook to continue file below

01_Neural_Network_Regression_with_Tensorflow-2nd-learning_rate-adjustment-to-.01.ipynb -- shows the more accurate model
